## Project Description
Our website is basically about a particular hospital, from getting the information about the hospital to booking an appointment & getting prescribed (online/offline). We are also generating files of patients who have visited/are visiting the hospital before & have overcome a disease. We have also provided a link for a medical shop just in-case if the patient needs them, he/she can order it online.

We came up with this idea seeing the current situation around the world. The COVID-19 situation brought us the idea of how much there is a requirement for such website. Seeing the situation everybody would like to book appointment online rather than waiting in queue for it. For normal fever, cough, etc., people can be prescribed online rather than going there & wasting their time. Nobody will have to maintain a file, everything will be stored online resulting in less paper used & going green.
